# Running

1. `git lfs pull`
2. `tar -xvjf dataset/eval.tar.bz2`

# Primary Goals

1. Count assertions with method sequences (i.e; assertEquals(0, a.foo().bar()))
2. Find distribution of method sequence lengths
3. How many method sequenced assertions have input arguments?
4. Find distribution of assertions appearing in one test
5. Find distribution of assertion types

<!-- add depth + length -->

<!-- assertEquals(-1,Primitive.toUInt32(c.toJsonObject().getInt(UInt32.FIELD_DATA))); -->
